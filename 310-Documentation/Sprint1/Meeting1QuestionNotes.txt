Scrum #1:
  Meeting 1:
    Question 1: What do the stakeholders mean when they say want the three lists
                to be reordered?
      - Does this mean reordering the contents of the list?
        -- If so, does this mean by alphabetical, cost of time, is this up to us?
      - Does this mean reordering the lists in the drop down menu?
    Question 2: How are we going to overcome challenges like being able to meet
                up at least six times for Scrum #1?
      - We decided to make our best effort to meet up after classes
      - We're going to have a skype call session this Saturday because we 
        won't all be in town

    Approach to setting radius in restaurant search:
      - Edit the calls to the google API to include a range
      - Implement front end form to the search page to allow the user to set a range
      - Include new form entry in the front end call to the back end

    Approach to reordering any of the three lists:
      - Current understanding is that this might mean reordering the items inside each list
      - This can be done using javascript when pressing and holding down the item and switching places with each item it passes
      - This can update the list on the front-end and when done it should update the list on the server
